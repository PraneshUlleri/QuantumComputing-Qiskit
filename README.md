# üß† Quantum Computing with Qiskit

Welcome to my Quantum Computing repository! This project is dedicated to exploring the fundamentals and advanced concepts of quantum computing using [Qiskit](https://qiskit.org/), an open-source SDK developed by IBM for working with quantum computers.

## üöÄ What's Inside

This repository includes:

- üìö **Learning Notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks covering the basics of quantum mechanics, quantum gates, and circuits.
- üî¨ **Qiskit Tutorials**: Hands-on examples using Qiskit including circuit construction, visualization, and execution on simulators or real quantum hardware.
- üß© **Mini Projects**: Implementations of key quantum algorithms:
  - Quantum Teleportation
  - Deutsch-Jozsa Algorithm
  - Grover's Algorithm
  - Quantum Fourier Transform
- üìà **Visualization Tools**: Circuit diagrams and quantum state visualizations using Qiskit's built-in tools.
- üß™ **Experiments**: Explorations of quantum noise, measurement errors, and hardware constraints.

## üí° Goals

- Build an intuitive understanding of quantum principles.
- Learn how to use Qiskit effectively for real-world quantum applications.
- Serve as a personal knowledge base and resource for the community.
